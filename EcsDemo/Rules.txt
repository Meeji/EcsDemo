Witcher Geralt has a contract to kill drowners!
He wanders aimlessly through a 32x32 grid.
A random selection of 250 blocks contain trees which cannot be passed by Witcher or drowner.
When a drowner emerges he immediately senses it with his enhanced witcher faculties.
He chases the drowner down.
When he is within 5 blocks of the drowner, the drowner sense Geralt and attempts to run away.
If Geralt and a drowner occupy the same square the drowner is killed and Gerlat gains 5 orens.
Once Geralt kills his target drowner he will chase the nearest drowner.
If there are no drowners he'll go back to wandering.
If two drowners occupy the same square one of them kills the other.
